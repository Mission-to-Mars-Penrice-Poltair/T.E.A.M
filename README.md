## Day 1 Retrospective

### What went well- we were able to communicate together well

### What didn't go well - we didn't really how to put the pseudocode into physical code

### What we will do more of tomorrow - break the code down with comments in the program

### What we will do less of tomorrow - stay more hydrated during work

## Day 2 Retrospective

### What went well - we made a lot of progress in the stories

### What didn't go well - had a lot of syntax errors in the code that we struggled to repair

### What we will do more of tomorrow - stay hydrated and find syntax resources	

### What we will do less of tomorrow - make less syntax errors

## Final Retrospective

### The experience of Mission to Mars was good and we enjoyed it, however we don't think we were
 as productive as we could have been due to our knowledge of c++ and our time management and 
organisation. However, on the whole, we worked well together as a team and enjoyed the experience.
